Amazon Code Challenges

Adding some of the code I came up with for the Amazon interviewing process. 

Order Sorting : I did not do well during the challenge, I worked on the information I had after the testto understand what was being asked. 
  Defnitely took me longer than the time allowed to complete this. 

Predict Rainfall : I had issues coming up with a way to evluate the days expanding on each side of the current day and checking their increasing/decreasing values
  I did not get a solution for this completed in time.

Minimum Prcessor Time: This is similar to the one I did in a challenge but had it come up on HackerRank. I did not make it work in the challenge, but I now have
  and understanding of what the problem is and how to solve it.
