Notes on the requirements for Order Sorting

All orders start with an alphanumeric ID code, followed by order metadata
Prime orders contain sapce separated lowercase letters
Non Prime orders contain space separated numbers
The sorted order list should have Prime orders above Non Prime Orders
The orders should be sorted by the metadata in lexicographical order
If the metada is a match to other orders, they should be sorted by the identifier
